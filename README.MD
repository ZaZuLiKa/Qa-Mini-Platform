This application I created for myself helps reduce working hours. It generates standard checklists for basic website testing. After completing the tests, it can export results as PDF, Excel, or CSV files, saving me a lot of time when testing one-off projects from freelance platforms.

If you use this app, you can edit the JSON file to add more entries and make it even more useful. You can also modify the index.html file to add more categories to choose from.

For me, this setup is more than enough right now. I wrote this app for a single project in one night, so it’s simple and doesn’t handle more than that—but it does exactly what I need.
